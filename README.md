1. Open a terminal window
2. Navigate to where you would like to store the folder
3. Type git clone https://github.com/mdinh7/blackjack.git
4. After it is done, run npm install
5. If you don't have npm/node you can install it through homebrew: https://brew.sh/ (by typing brew install node)
6. If you plan on developing on top of this, you need to run "webpack" in your terminal after javascript changes.
7. You can run the game by typing "open index.html" or just opening the html file.
